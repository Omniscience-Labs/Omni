Region: Oregon (or closest to you)
Branch: main
Root Directory: mcp-servers/klaviyo
Runtime: Node
Build Command: npm install && npm run build

### 5. Deploy!

Click **"Create Web Service"**

Render will:
- Clone your repo
- Install dependencies
- Build TypeScript
- Start the server

Wait 2-3 minutes for deploy to complete.

### 6. Get Your URL

Once deployed, you'll see a URL like:
```
https://klaviyo-mcp.onrender.com
```

### 7. Test It

```bash
curl https://klaviyo-mcp.onrender.com/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"healthy","service":"klaviyo-mcp-server"}
```

### 8. Connect in Omni

Go to Omni UI and add MCP connection:

```
Transport Method: SSE
Name: Klaviyo
URL: https://klaviyo-mcp.onrender.com/sse
                                         ^^^^ Don't forget /sse!
```

Click "Test Connection" - you should see **14 tools**! üéâ

## Troubleshooting

### Deploy Failed?

Check build logs in Render dashboard. Common issues:
- Missing `package.json` ‚Üí Make sure root directory is `mcp-servers/klaviyo`
- Build errors ‚Üí Check that TypeScript compiles locally first

### Health Check Fails?

- Wait a minute after deploy completes
- Check service logs in Render
- Make sure `KLAVIYO_API_KEY` is set

### Still No Tools in Omni?

- Double-check URL ends with `/sse`
- Check Render logs for connection attempts
- Make sure Klaviyo API key is valid

## Free Tier Notes

Render's free tier:
- ‚úÖ Works great for testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Takes ~30 seconds to wake up on first request

For production, upgrade to Starter ($7/month) for always-on service.

## Next Steps

Once deployed and connected:
1. ‚úÖ Tools will persist (no more ngrok restarts!)
2. ‚úÖ Works from anywhere (Render is in the cloud)
3. ‚úÖ Can share with team members
4. ‚úÖ Can add to multiple agents

Enjoy your Klaviyo integration! üöÄ
