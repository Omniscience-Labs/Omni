## Thread Basics

Threads are individual conversations with agents that live within projects. Each thread maintains its own context and history while sharing project-level resources.

## Creating Threads

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start New Thread">
    Within any project:
    - Click **New Thread** button
    - Use keyboard shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl + N`
    - Or click agent name to start fresh conversation

    {/* 
      ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: New Thread Options
      - Multiple entry points highlighted
      - Quick action menu visible
      - Agent selector shown
      - Size: 1200x800px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Thread">
    Give it a descriptive name:
    ```
    Good: "Email Campaign Copy - Version 1"
    Better: "Launch Email Sequence - A/B Test Variants"
    ```

    <Tip>
      Name threads immediately while context is fresh. You can always rename later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Agent (Optional)">
    Choose which agent to use:
    - Project default
    - Specific agent for this task
    - Multiple agents in sequence

    Different threads can use different agents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One Focus Per Thread" icon="bullseye">
    Keep each thread focused on a single deliverable or goal:
    
    **Good**:
    ```
    Thread 1: "Blog Post - AI Trends 2024"
    Thread 2: "Social Posts - AI Trends Promotion"
    Thread 3: "Newsletter - AI Trends Feature"
    ```

    **Avoid**:
    ```
    Thread 1: "All AI Trends Content"
    (blog + social + newsletter + graphics)
    ```

    Focused threads are easier to navigate and reference later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Include key information in thread names:

    **Template**: `[Type] - [Topic] - [Version/Status]`

    Examples:
    - "Report - Q3 Sales Analysis - Draft"
    - "Email - Product Launch - Final"
    - "Presentation - Investor Deck - v3"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Cleanup" icon="broom">
    Weekly maintenance:
    - âœ“ Mark completed threads as done
    - âœ“ Archive old threads
    - âœ“ Rename unclear threads
    - âœ“ Export important conversations

    Keeps workspace manageable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
