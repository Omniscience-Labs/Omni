## Understanding Threads

Threads are individual conversations with agents within a project. Each thread maintains its own context and history.

### Thread Structure

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Conversation Flow" icon="messages">
    Each thread contains:
    - Your messages and requests
    - Agent responses and actions
    - Tool usage history
    - Generated files and outputs
    - Timestamps and status

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Thread Anatomy
      - Annotated screenshot of a single thread
      - Labels showing different message types
      - Tool usage indicators highlighted
      - File attachments visible
      - Size: 1600x1000px
    */}
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Context Preservation" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Threads remember:
    - All previous messages
    - Files uploaded or created
    - Agent configurations used
    - Tool preferences
    - Project-level knowledge

    Return anytime to continue where you left off.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Independent Execution" icon="split">
    Each thread can:
    - Use different agents
    - Have unique focus areas
    - Run simultaneously
    - Share project resources
    - Maintain separate file spaces
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Project Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create">
    Start a new project for each major initiative or goal.

    <Tip>
      Create projects early - it's easier to organize from the start than to reorganize later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build">
    Add threads as work progresses:
    - Start with broad exploration
    - Branch into specific subtasks
    - Create focused threads for deliverables

    {/* 
      üé• VIDEO PLACEHOLDER: Project Growth (30 seconds)
      - Show project starting with 1 thread
      - New threads being created
      - Thread list growing organically
      - Files accumulating
      - Team members joining
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Collaborate">
    Invite team members:
    - View-only access for stakeholders
    - Edit access for contributors
    - Admin access for project leads

    Real-time updates keep everyone aligned.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Archive">
    When work completes:
    - Export all files and conversations
    - Archive for future reference
    - Maintain searchable history
    - Free up active workspace

    <Info>
      Archived projects remain accessible but don't clutter your active view.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Thread Management Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Descriptive Names">
    **Good Thread Names**:
    ```
    ‚úÖ "Q4 Product Launch - Email Sequence"
    ‚úÖ "Customer Onboarding Guide v2"
    ‚úÖ "Weekly Metrics Dashboard"
    ‚úÖ "Bug #247 - Payment Flow Investigation"
    ```

    **Poor Thread Names**:
    ```
    ‚ùå "Chat 1"
    ‚ùå "New Thread"
    ‚ùå "Untitled"
    ‚ùå "Test"
    ```

    Clear names help you find threads months later.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Consistent Structure">
    Use patterns for similar work:
    ```
    Client work: "[Client Name] - [Task]"
    Product features: "[Feature Name] - [Aspect]"
    Reports: "[Report Type] - [Period]"
    Research: "[Topic] - [Focus Area]"
    ```

    Consistency makes navigation intuitive.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
