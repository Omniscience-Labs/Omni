  <Tab title="Issue Management">
    **Automated Triage**:
    ```
    "Review open issues in my-org/my-repo:
    - Categorize by type (bug, feature, question)
    - Assign appropriate labels
    - Flag issues missing information
    - Suggest priorities based on impact
    - Create summary for team standup"
    ```

    {/* 
      ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Issue Triage
      - GitHub issues list
      - Agent's categorization overlaid
      - Labels being applied

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scope Repositories Carefully" icon="bullseye">
    **Recommendations**:
    - Development agents: Full access to dev repos
    - Documentation agents: Read-only access
    - Automation agents: Specific repos only
    - General agents: No GitHub access

    Principle of least privilege.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Templates" icon="file-lines">
    **Standardize Issue Creation**:
    ```
    Bug Report Template:
    - Steps to reproduce
    - Expected vs actual behavior
    - Environment details
    - Screenshots/logs
    - Severity level
    ```

    Teach agents your issue format.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combine with Slack" icon="link">
    **Powerful Combination**:
    - GitHub activity â†’ Slack notifications
    - Slack questions â†’ GitHub issue creation
    - PR reviews â†’ Slack summaries

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission Denied" icon="ban">
    **Causes**:
    - Organization didn't grant access
    - Repository permissions insufficient
    - Token expired
    - Branch protection blocking

    **Fix**: Update permissions in GitHub â†’ Omni integration settings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't Find Repository" icon="question">
    **Check**:
    - Repository name spelling
    - Organization name included
    - Access granted during OAuth
    - Repository exists and isn't archived

    Format: `organization/repository-name`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Exceeded" icon="gauge-high">
    **GitHub Limits**:
    - 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users
    - Varies by endpoint

    **Solution**: Omni automatically retries, or wait for limit reset
  </Accordion>
