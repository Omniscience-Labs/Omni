## Smart Scheduling

Let agents handle complex coordination:

<Steps>
  <Step title="State Your Constraints">
    Provide scheduling requirements:
    ```
    "Find time for a 90-minute workshop:
    - Needs: Me, John, Sarah, Mike
    - This month only
    - Must be afternoon (after 2 PM)
    - No Fridays
    - Prefer earlier in month"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Analyzes">
    Behind the scenes:
    - Checks all participant calendars
    - Applies stated constraints
    - Considers time zones
    - Respects working hours
    - Evaluates travel/buffer time

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Scheduling Analysis
      - Calendar grid showing analysis process
      - Available slots highlighted in green
      - Conflicts shown in red
      - Optimal times marked with stars
      - Size: 1600x1000px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Options">
    Agent presents best options:
    ```
    Found 3 time slots that work for everyone:
    
    1. Tuesday, Mar 12 at 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM (Best)
       ‚úì All attendees available
       ‚úì Early in month as preferred
       ‚úì No adjacent meetings
    
    2. Wednesday, Mar 13 at 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM
       ‚úì All available
       ‚ö†Ô∏è Mike has meeting right after
    
    3. Thursday, Mar 21 at 2:30 PM - 4:00 PM
       ‚úì All available
       ‚ö†Ô∏è Later than preferred
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm and Book">

    **Configure**:
    - Standard working hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
    - Lunch blocks
    - Focus time preferences
    - Meeting-free days

    Agents respect your boundaries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Buffer Time" icon="hourglass">

    - 10-15 minute buffers
    - Travel time for in-person
    - Prep/debrief time

    Maintain sustainability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Template Events" icon="file-lines">
    **Create Reusable Templates**:
    ```
    1-on-1 Template:
    - Duration: 30 minutes

## Limitations

<Info>
  **Google Calendar API Limits**:
  - 1,000,000 requests per day
  - 100 requests per 100 seconds per user

  More than sufficient for typical agent usage. Omni manages limits automatically.
</Info>

---

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events Not Appearing" icon="calendar-xmark">
    **Check**:
    - Correct calendar selected
    - Time zone settings
    - Calendar shared with Omni
    - Sync completed

    Refresh connection if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't Create Events" icon="ban">
    **Possible Issues**:
    - Write permission not granted
    - Calendar is read-only
    - Conflicting event exists
    - Time zone mismatch

    Re-authenticate with write permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timezone Issues" icon="earth-americas">
    **Timezone Handling**:
    - Always specify timezone: "2 PM PT", "15:00 UTC"
    - Set default timezone in settings
    - Agent converts automatically
    - Verify in calendar after creation

    Be explicit to avoid confusion.
