## What You Can Do

Once connected, agents can manage your Gmail account through natural conversation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Read Emails" icon="envelope-open">
    Check inbox, search messages, read threads
  </Card>
  <Card title="Send Messages" icon="paper-plane">
    Compose and send emails (see note about attachments below)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Organize" icon="folder">
    Apply labels, mark as read, archive, star
  </Card>
  <Card title="Filter & Search" icon="filter">
    Find emails by sender, subject, date, labels
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Gmail Attachment Limitation**: The Gmail API currently does not support sending emails with file attachments through automation.
  
  **Workaround**:
  1. Agent can draft the email content and save it
  2. Go to the **Files panel** and download the attachment files
  3. Manually send the email through Gmail with downloaded attachments
  
  Alternatively, the agent can compose the email and you can copy the text to send manually with attachments.
</Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Google OAuth">

      - Modify messages (mark read, archive)
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    **Optional Configuration**:
    - Enable/disable attachment access
    - Set default label handling
    - Configure notification preferences
    - Set up filters

    Defaults work for most users.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Agents">
    The Gmail connection (profile) is now available:
    - Shows in your list of integration profiles
    - Can be used by any agent
    - Create additional Gmail profiles for different accounts
    - Example: "Marketing Gmail", "Support Gmail", "Personal Gmail"

    <Check>
      Gmail connected! Test with: "What are my unread emails?"
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Multiple Gmail Accounts**: You can create multiple Gmail integration profiles. Name each profile clearly (e.g., "Marketing Email", "Support Email") and select which profile an agent should use in its integration settings.

## Common Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Inbox Management">
    **Automated Email Triage**:
    ```
    "Check my inbox and:
    - Summarize unread messages
    - Flag urgent items
    - Draft responses for routine inquiries
    - Create tasks from action items"
    ```

    Agent processes your inbox intelligently.

    {/* 
      📸 MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Email Summary
      - Agent's response showing categorized emails
      - Priority indicators
      - Quick actions for each email
      - Size: 1600x900px
    */}
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Email Composition">
    **Assisted Writing**:
    ```
    "Draft an email to john@example.com:
    - Subject: Q4 Partnership Proposal
    - Thank them for meeting last week
    - Suggest next steps
    - Professional and warm tone"
    ```

    Agent composes complete email with subject, body, and formatting.
    
    **Example from Demo**:
    ```
    "Send all the above information including the image and 
    presentation along with phone number to [email]"
    
    Result: Agent sends email with:
    - Professional greeting
    - All requested information formatted nicely
    - Company details and contact info
    - Note about attachments (see limitation below)
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      **Attachments Workaround**: When agent says "I've sent the email but couldn't attach files due to API limitations":
      1. Check the email was sent successfully
      2. Go to Files panel in Omni
      3. Download the files you need to attach
      4. Reply to the sent email manually with attachments
      
      Or have agent draft without sending, copy text, and send manually with attachments from start.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Follow-Up Automation">
    **Never Miss Follow-Ups**:
    ```
    "Check for emails I sent last week that haven't 
    received a response. Draft polite follow-ups for each."
    ```

    Maintain communication without manual tracking.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Data Extraction">
    **Extract Information**:
    ```
    "Find all emails from clients containing invoices.
    Extract invoice numbers, amounts, and due dates.
    Create a spreadsheet with this data."
    ```

    Turn emails into structured data.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
