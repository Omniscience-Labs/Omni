## Connection Process

All integrations follow a secure, standardized connection flow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations** or click any **Connect** button in agent configuration.

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Integrations Page
      - Available integrations grid
      - Search and category filters
      - Connected vs available tabs
      - Size: 1800x1000px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Service to Connect">
    Browse or search for the service you want to integrate.

    Popular services shown first with install counts and ratings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Permissions">
    Before connecting, review what access Omni requests:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Read Permissions" icon="eye">
        View data without modifying:
        - Read emails/messages
        - View calendar events
        - Access files
        - List repositories

        **Lowest risk** - recommended to start
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Write Permissions" icon="pen">
        Create and modify content:
        - Send emails/messages
        - Create calendar events
        - Edit files
        - Create issues/tickets

        **Medium risk** - verify before granting
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Delete Permissions" icon="trash">
        Remove content:
        - Delete emails
        - Remove calendar events
        - Delete files
        - Close issues

        **Highest risk** - only if necessary

        <Warning>
          Delete permissions are optional. Most use cases don't require them.
        </Warning>
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Click **Connect [Service]** and complete OAuth flow:
    1. Redirected to service login
    2. Log in with your credentials
    3. Review permission request
    4. Click **Allow** or **Authorize**
    5. Redirected back to Omni

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: OAuth Flow
      - Three-panel showing: Omni ‚Üí Service Login ‚Üí Permission Request
      - Arrows showing flow between screens
      - Security indicators highlighted
      - Size: 2000x800px
    */}

    <Tip>
      Use the account you want agents to act on behalf of. For team integrations, use a shared service account.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Integration">
    Set integration-specific options:
    - Which folders/channels to access
    - Default settings
    - Notification preferences
    - Usage limits

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Integration Config
      - Service-specific settings panel
      - Toggle options for features
      - Test connection button
      - Advanced settings collapsed
      - Size: 1400x800px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Agents">
    Enable for specific agents:
    - Select agents from list
    - Or enable for all agents
    - Set per-agent permissions
    - Configure tool subsets

    <Check>
      Integration active and ready to use!
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Verify it works:
    ```
    Ask agent: "List my recent Gmail messages"
    Expected: Agent retrieves and displays emails
    ```

    Fix any issues before regular use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Failed" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Common Causes**:
    - Popup blocker prevented OAuth window
    - Wrong credentials used
    - Service temporarily unavailable
    - Permissions denied

    **Solutions**:
    1. Allow popups from Omni
    2. Try again with correct account
    3. Check service status page
    4. Review and accept all permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Expired" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Why Tokens Expire**:
    - Security best practice
    - Password changed on service
    - Permissions modified
    - Token manually revoked

    **Fix**: Click **Reconnect** and re-authenticate

    <Info>
      Most services require re-authentication every 30-90 days for security.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Not Working" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Diagnostic Steps**:
    1. Check integration status (Active?)
    2. Verify agent has access enabled
    3. Review error logs
    4. Test with simple request
    5. Re-authenticate connection
    6. Contact support if persists

    Include error messages when contacting support.
