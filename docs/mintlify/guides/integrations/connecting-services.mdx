## Connection Process

All integrations follow a secure, standardized connection flow.

<Info>
  **Integration Profiles**: You can create multiple connections to the same service (e.g., separate Gmail profiles for "Marketing", "Support", and "Personal"). Each connection is called a "profile" and can be used by different agents.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    Access integrations from two locations:
    - **Agent Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations** tab (agent-specific)
    - **Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations** (global view)
    
    You'll see available integrations organized by category.

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Integrations Page

      - Search and category filters

      - Size: 1800x1000px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Service to Connect">
    **Find Your Integration**:
    1. Use search bar to find service (e.g., "Outlook", "OneDrive", "Dropbox")
    2. Click on the integration card
    3. Click **Create New Connection**
    
    You'll be prompted to name this connection.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name Your Connection Profile">
    Give this connection a descriptive name:
    ```
    Examples:
    - "Houston Email" (for work Outlook)
    - "Marketing Gmail" (for marketing emails)
    - "Work OneDrive" (for corporate files)
    - "Support Email" (for customer support)
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      Profile names help you remember which account is connected, especially when you have multiple connections to the same service type.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Permissions">
    Before connecting, review what access Omni requests:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Read Permissions" icon="eye">
        View data without modifying:
        - Read emails/messages
        - View calendar events
        - Access files
        - List repositories

        **Lowest risk** - recommended to start
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Write Permissions" icon="pen">
        Create and modify content:
        - Send emails/messages
        - Create calendar events
        - Edit files
        - Create issues/tickets

        **Medium risk** - verify before granting
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Delete Permissions" icon="trash">
        Remove content:
        - Delete emails
        - Remove calendar events
        - Delete files
        - Close issues

        **Highest risk** - only if necessary

        <Warning>
          Delete permissions are optional. Most use cases don't require them.
        </Warning>
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Click **Connect** button and complete OAuth flow:
    1. Popup window opens (allow popups in browser)
    2. Log in to the service with your credentials
    3. Review permission request from Omni
    4. Click **Allow**, **Authorize**, or **Accept**
    5. Window closes and you're back in Omni
    
    <Warning>
      **Enterprise Services**: Outlook, OneDrive, and other Microsoft services may require IT administrator approval before you can connect. If you see "Admin consent required" or similar error:
      
      1. Contact your IT department
      2. Ask them to approve Omni in Microsoft 365 admin console
      3. They need to whitelist Omni as an approved app
      4. Then retry the connection
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      Use the account you want agents to act on behalf of. For team integrations, use a shared service account.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Tools to Enable">
    **Choose Specific Capabilities**:
    
    After authentication succeeds, you'll see a list of available tools for this integration. Toggle switches to enable/disable each capability:
    
    **Example - OneDrive Tools**:
    ```
    ‚òë List files and folders
    ‚òë Download files
    ‚òë Read file contents
    ‚òê Upload files (optional)
    ‚òê Delete files (optional - usually keep off for safety)
    ```
    
    **Example - Gmail Tools**:
    ```
    ‚òë Read emails
    ‚òë Send emails
    ‚òë Search inbox
    ‚òê Delete emails (optional)
    ‚òê Manage labels (optional)
    ```
    
    Only enable what you actually need for security and focus.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Tools Configuration">
    Click the **Save Tools** button to confirm your selections.
    
    Your choices are saved and the integration is now active.

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Integration Config

      - Toggle options for features
      - Test connection button
      - Advanced settings collapsed
      - Size: 1400x800px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Integration profile is now ready to use. Verify it works:
    ```
    Ask agent: "List my recent Gmail messages"
    Expected: Agent retrieves and displays emails
    ```

    Fix any issues before regular use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Failed" icon="circle-xmark">
    **Common Causes**:
    - Popup blocker prevented OAuth window
    - Wrong credentials used
    - Service temporarily unavailable
    - Permissions denied

    **Solutions**:
    1. Allow popups from Omni
    2. Try again with correct account
    3. Check service status page
    4. Review and accept all permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Expired" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Why Tokens Expire**:
    - Security best practice
    - Password changed on service
    - Permissions modified
    - Token manually revoked

    **Fix**: Click **Reconnect** and re-authenticate

    <Info>
      Most services require re-authentication every 30-90 days for security.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Not Working" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Diagnostic Steps**:
    1. Check integration status (Active?)
    2. Verify agent has access enabled
    3. Review error logs
    4. Test with simple request
    5. Re-authenticate connection
    6. Contact support if persists

    Include error messages when contacting support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration Profiles System

<Info>
  **Key Concept**: Profiles let you have multiple connections to the same service type. For example:
  
  **Gmail Profiles**:
  - "Marketing Gmail" ‚Üí marketing@company.com
  - "Support Gmail" ‚Üí support@company.com  
  - "Personal Gmail" ‚Üí yourname@gmail.com
  
  Different agents can use different profiles. A support agent uses the Support Gmail profile, while a marketing agent uses the Marketing Gmail profile.
</Info>

**Viewing Your Profiles**:

Access **Settings ‚Üí Integrations** or agent **Integrations tab** to see:
- All service types (Gmail, Outlook, OneDrive, etc.)
- Multiple profiles under each service
- Connection status for each profile
- Last sync time
- Which agents use which profiles

**Creating Additional Profiles**:

Already have OneDrive connected but need a second account?
1. Go to Integrations
2. Find OneDrive  
3. Click **Create New Connection** (even though one exists)
4. Name it differently ("Personal OneDrive" vs "Work OneDrive")
5. Authenticate with different Microsoft account
6. Select tools and save
