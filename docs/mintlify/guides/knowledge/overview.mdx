## What is the Knowledge Base?

Your Knowledge Base is a centralized repository of documents, data, and information that agents can access to provide context-aware, informed responses.

## How Agents Use Knowledge

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Upload Documents">
    Add company documents, research, product info, or any relevant content to your Knowledge Base.

    <Tip>
      The more relevant information you provide, the more accurate and helpful your agents become.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI Processes Content">
    Omni automatically:
    - Extracts text from documents
    - Creates semantic embeddings
    - Indexes for fast retrieval
    - Maintains relationships between concepts

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Processing Pipeline
      - Diagram showing file ‚Üí extraction ‚Üí indexing ‚Üí search
      - Visual representation of semantic embeddings
      - Icons for different file types
      - Size: 1600x800px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Searches Automatically">
    During conversations, agents:
    - Detect when knowledge would be helpful
    - Search semantically (not just keywords)
    - Find most relevant passages
    - Include sources in responses

    No manual search required.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Context-Aware Responses">
    Agents provide answers that:
    - Reference your specific documents
    - Use your company's terminology
    - Cite sources with confidence scores
    - Maintain context across conversation

    {/* 
      üé• VIDEO PLACEHOLDER: Knowledge in Action (30 seconds)
      - User asks agent a question
      - Agent searches knowledge base (visual indicator)
      - Relevant documents highlighted
      - Agent responds with citations
      - User clicks citation to see source
    */}
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Search Capabilities

### Semantic Search

Unlike traditional keyword search, semantic search understands **meaning**:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Question: 'What's our refund policy?'" icon="question">
    Finds documents about:
    - Returns and refunds
    - Money-back guarantees
    - Customer satisfaction policies
    
    Even if they don't use the word "refund"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Query: 'employee benefits'" icon="search">
    Discovers content about:
    - Health insurance
    - 401k retirement plans
    - Paid time off
    - Professional development
    
    Related concepts automatically included
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Advanced Search Features

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Natural Language">

    ```
    "What did the Q3 report say about revenue growth?"
    "Find information about our API rate limits"
    "Show me guidelines for social media posting"
    ```

    No need for exact keywords or Boolean operators.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Filters">
    Narrow results by:
    - **File Type**: Documents, spreadsheets, presentations
    - **Date Range**: Last week, month, year, custom
    - **Folder**: Specific directories only

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Content Current" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Regular Updates**:
    - ‚úì Remove outdated documents quarterly
    - ‚úì Update product documentation with releases
    - ‚úì Archive old policies and procedures
    - ‚úì Mark versions clearly (v1.0, v2.0)

    Agents perform better with current information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organize Logically" icon="sitemap">
    **Clear Structure**:
    ```
    /Company Policies
      /HR
        - Employee Handbook.pdf
        - Benefits Guide.pdf
      /IT
        - Security Policy.pdf
        - Equipment Guidelines.pdf
    /Product Documentation
      /User Guides
      /API Reference
      /Release Notes
    ```

    Intuitive organization helps you and your team find content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    **Good Filenames**:
    ```
    ‚úÖ "2024-Product-Roadmap-Q1-Q4.pdf"
    ‚úÖ "Customer-Onboarding-Checklist-v2.docx"
    ‚úÖ "API-Authentication-Guide.md"

    **Poor Filenames**:
    ```
    ‚ùå "document1.pdf"
    ‚ùå "final_FINAL_v3.docx"
    ‚ùå "Untitled.pdf"
    ```

    Clear names improve searchability.
