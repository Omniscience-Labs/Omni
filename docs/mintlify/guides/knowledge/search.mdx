## How Semantic Search Works

Unlike traditional keyword search, semantic search understands meaning and context.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Keyword Search" icon="key">
    **Traditional Method**:
    - Matches exact words
    - Requires correct terminology
    - Misses synonyms and related concepts
    - No context understanding

    **Example**:
    Search for "refund policy" only finds documents with those exact words.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Semantic Search" icon="brain">
    **AI-Powered Method**:
    - Understands meaning and intent
    - Finds synonyms automatically
    - Connects related concepts
    - Considers context

    **Example**:
    Search for "refund policy" also finds:
    - Return procedures
    - Money-back guarantees
    - Customer satisfaction policies
    - Cancellation terms

    {/* 
      ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Semantic vs Keyword Comparison
      - Side-by-side comparison
      - Same query, different results
      - Highlight missed results in keyword search
      - Show relevance scores

## Search Techniques

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask Natural Questions">
    Write queries as if talking to a person:

    **Good Queries**:
    ```
    "What is our remote work policy?"
    "How do I submit an expense report?"
    "What are the API rate limits for premium users?"
    "Show me the latest product roadmap"
    ```

    **Less Effective**:
    ```
    "remote work"
    "expense"
    "API limits"
    "roadmap"
    ```

    Complete questions get better results.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Be Specific When Needed">
    Add context for precision:

    **Generic**:
    ```
    "security policy"
    ```

    **Specific**:
    ```
    "What does our security policy say about password requirements?"
    ```

    More specific = more relevant results.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Filters">
    Narrow results by:
    - **File Type**: PDF, Word, Spreadsheet
    - **Date**: Last week, month, year, custom
    - **Folder**: Specific directories
    - **Tags**: Custom categorization
    - **Author**: Who uploaded

    {/* 
      ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Search Filters
      - Filter panel expanded
      - Multiple active filters
      - Clear individual filter option
      - Results updating live
      - Size: 1400x900px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    Each result shows:
    - **Relevance Score**: How well it matches
    - **Preview**: Excerpt with highlighted terms
    - **Source**: Document name and location
    - **Date**: When uploaded/modified
    - **Quick Actions**: View, download, share

    <Tip>
      Results are sorted by relevance, but you can re-sort by date or name.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Step title="Ask Agent Naturally">
    During any conversation:
    ```
    "What does our employee handbook say about vacation days?"
    ```

    Agent searches knowledge base automatically.

    {/* 
      ðŸŽ¥ VIDEO PLACEHOLDER: Agent Search (30 seconds)
      - User asks question
      - Agent searches knowledge base (visual indicator)
      - Results found and synthesized
      - Agent responds with citations
      - User clicks citation to see source
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Sources">
    Agent provides:
    - Direct answer
    - Source document names
    - Relevant page numbers
    - Confidence scores
    - Links to full documents

    Click any source to view original.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine if Needed">
