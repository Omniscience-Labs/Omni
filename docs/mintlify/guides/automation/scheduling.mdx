## Quick Scheduling

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Schedules">
    **Common Patterns**:

    | Pattern | Cron Expression | Description |
    |---------|----------------|-------------|
    | Every hour | `0 * * * *` | At minute 0 of every hour |
    | Daily at 9 AM | `0 9 * * *` | Every day at 9:00 AM |
    | Weekdays at 8 AM | `0 8 * * 1-5` | Mon-Fri at 8:00 AM |
    | Weekly on Monday | `0 9 * * 1` | Mondays at 9:00 AM |
    | Monthly on 1st | `0 9 1 * *` | 1st of month at 9:00 AM |

    No cron expertise needed - use presets.

    {/* 
      ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Schedule Presets
      - Dropdown showing common patterns
      - Visual calendar showing when it runs
      - Next 5 execution times preview
      - Custom cron option
      - Size: 1400x800px
    */}
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom Schedules">
    **Advanced Patterns**:
    ```
    First Monday of each quarter at 2 PM:
    0 14 1-7 1,4,7,10 1
    
    Every 6 hours on weekdays:
    0 */6 * * 1-5
    
    Twice daily (9 AM and 5 PM):
    0 9,17 * * *
    ```

    Use cron expression builder for complex patterns.

    <Tip>
      Use our visual cron builder - no need to memorize syntax.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Schedule Not Running" icon="question">
    **Check**:
    - Schedule is enabled (not paused)
    - Time hasn't passed yet
    - Timezone is correct
    - No execution limit reached

    View next run time in dashboard.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Running at Wrong Time" icon="clock">
    **Verify**:
    - Cron expression is correct
    - Timezone matches expectation
    - DST (daylight saving time) considered
    - Server time vs local time

    Use UTC to avoid DST issues.

  <Accordion title="Executions Failing" icon="xmark">
    **Common Causes**:
    - Workflow has bugs
    - Required data missing
    - Integration disconnected
    - Rate limits exceeded

    Fix workflow, then reschedule.
