      - Trigger configuration form
      - Gmail event selector
      - Filter conditions

## Setting Up Triggers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Event Source">
    Select which service to monitor:
    - Must have integration connected
    - Pick specific event type
    - Configure event filters

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Event Source Selection
      - Service selector with icons
      - Event type dropdown
      - Filter configuration
      - Real-time test button
      - Size: 1600x900px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Conditions">
    Add filters to narrow when trigger fires:

    **Example - Gmail**:
    ```
    Event: New email received
    Conditions:
    - From: *@client-domain.com
    - Subject contains: "Invoice"
    - Has attachments: Yes
    ```

    Only matching emails trigger workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Action">
    Choose what happens:
    - **Run Workflow**: Execute specific workflow
    - **Start Agent Conversation**: Free-form task
    - **Send Notification**: Alert without action
    - **Chain Multiple Actions**: Sequential tasks

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Action Configuration
      - Action type selector
      - Workflow dropdown
      - Custom instructions textarea
      - Notification settings
      - Size: 1400x800px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Agent Context">
    Provide trigger-specific instructions:
    ```
    "When this trigger fires:
    - Extract invoice details from attachment
    - Add to accounting spreadsheet
    - Create task for accounts payable
    - Notify #finance channel"
    ```

    Context makes trigger actions precise.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Trigger">
    Verify trigger works:
    - Manually fire test event
    - Check trigger activates
    - Review workflow execution
    - Confirm expected behavior

    <Check>
      Trigger active! Will monitor for matching events.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Triggers

Trigger agents from external systems.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Webhook URL">
    In trigger settings, create webhook:
    - Omni provides unique URL
    - Includes authentication token
    - Optionally set IP whitelist

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Webhook URL
      - Generated webhook URL displayed
      - Copy button
      - Security settings
      - Example payload
      - Size: 1400x800px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure External System">
    Add webhook URL to your service:
    ```
    URL: https://api.omni.com/webhooks/abc123...
    Method: POST
    Headers: 
      Content-Type: application/json
      X-Auth-Token: your_token_here
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Payload Handling">
    Tell agent how to process webhook data:
    ```
    "Extract {{customer_id}} and {{order_total}} from 
    payload, then create order summary and notify team"
    ```

    Agent parses JSON automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Webhook Example

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.omni.com/webhooks/abc123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: your_token' \
  -d '{
    "event": "order.completed",
    "customer_id": "cust_123",
    "order_total": 599.99,
    "items": [...]
  }'
```

```json Payload Format
{
  "event": "order.completed",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-05T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "customer_id": "cust_123",
    "order_total": 599.99,
    "order_id": "ord_456"
  }
}
```

```python Python
import requests

webhook_url = "https://api.omni.com/webhooks/abc123"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-Auth-Token": "your_token"
}
data = {
    "event": "custom.event",
    "data": {"key": "value"}
}

response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=data, headers=headers)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Specific Conditions" icon="filter">
    **Be Selective**:
    ```
    ‚ùå Too Broad:
    Trigger: Any email received
    
    ‚úÖ Better:
    Trigger: Email from customer@domain.com 
             with "urgent" in subject
    ```

    Avoid triggering unnecessarily.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Before Activation" icon="flask">
    **Testing Checklist**:
    - ‚úì Trigger fires on correct events
    - ‚úì Doesn't fire on wrong events
    - ‚úì Workflow executes successfully
    - ‚úì Outputs are as expected
    - ‚úì Error handling works

    Prevent production issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Initially" icon="eye">
    **First Week**:
    - Check execution logs daily
    - Verify trigger accuracy
    - Adjust conditions if needed
    - Monitor for false positives

    Fine-tune for reliability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set Rate Limits" icon="gauge">
    **Prevent Overload**:
    - Maximum executions per hour
    - Cooldown between triggers
    - Batch multiple events
    - Queue during high volume

    Protect your systems.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trigger Not Firing" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Check**:
    - Trigger is enabled (not paused)
    - Integration is connected
    - Conditions are correct
    - Event actually occurred
    - No rate limit exceeded

    Review execution logs for clues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Many False Positives" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Refine Conditions**:
    - Add more specific filters
    - Narrow date ranges
    - Use exact matches vs contains
    - Test with historical data

    Precision over recall.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workflow Fails After Trigger" icon="xmark">
    **Diagnostic Steps**:
    1. Check workflow works manually
    2. Verify trigger passes correct data
    3. Review error logs
    4. Test with similar event data
    5. Fix workflow, not trigger

    Separate trigger vs workflow issues.
  </Accordion>
