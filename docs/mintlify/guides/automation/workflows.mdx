## What Are Workflows?

Workflows are pre-defined sequences of steps that agents follow consistently for recurring tasks.

## Creating Workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the Process">
    Start with a clear goal and list the steps:

    **Example - Weekly Report**:
    ```
    Goal: Generate weekly performance report
    
    Steps:
    1. Collect data from multiple sources
    2. Analyze metrics and trends
    3. Create visualizations
    4. Write executive summary
    5. Format as PDF
    6. Send to stakeholders
    ```

    Break down into discrete actions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Workflow">
    In agent settings â†’ **Workflows** â†’ **New Workflow**

    {/* 
      ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Workflow Creation
      - New workflow dialog
      - Name and description fields
      - Template selector
      - Step builder interface
      - Size: 1600x1000px
    */}

    Provide:
    - **Name**: Descriptive workflow title
    - **Description**: Purpose and scope
    - **Agent**: Which agent executes this
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Steps">
    Define each step sequentially:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Message Steps">
        Instructions for the agent:
        ```
        Step 1: "Collect sales data from @sales-sheet.csv"
        Step 2: "Analyze month-over-month growth"
        Step 3: "Create bar chart of top products"
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Tool-Specific Steps">
        Explicit tool usage:
        ```
        Step 1: Use web_search for "industry benchmarks"
        Step 2: Use code_execution to process data
        Step 3: Use file_operations to create report
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Conditional Steps">
        Logic and branching:
        ```
        Step 4: If growth > 10%, notify #sales-wins
                Otherwise, create improvement plan
        ```

        Add decision points.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    {/*

      - Condition builder for conditional steps
      - Variable insertion menu
      - Size: 1600x900px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Variables">
    Make workflows reusable with variables:

    ```
    {{date_range}} - Time period to analyze
    {{recipient}} - Who receives the report
    {{threshold}} - Alert threshold
    {{department}} - Which team's data
    ```

    Variables filled in when workflow runs.

    <Tip>
      Use descriptive variable names like {{start_date}} instead of {{var1}}.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Workflow">
    Run with test data:
    - Fill in variable values
    - Execute workflow
    - Review outputs
    - Fix any issues
    - Test edge cases

    {/* 
      ðŸŽ¥ VIDEO PLACEHOLDER: Workflow Testing (40 seconds)
      - Click "Test Workflow" button
      - Fill in test variables
      - Watch execution progress
      - Review generated outputs
      - Make adjustments
