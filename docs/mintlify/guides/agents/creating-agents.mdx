## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Clear Purpose" icon="bullseye">
    Give each agent a specific, well-defined role rather than making it do everything
  </Card>
  <Card title="Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Use names that immediately tell you what the agent does
  </Card>
  <Card title="Specific Prompts" icon="message">
    Write detailed system prompts with examples of desired behavior
  </Card>
  <Card title="Right Tools Only" icon="filter">
    Enable only the tools needed for the agent's specific tasks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  **Avoid Creating Too Many Similar Agents**: Instead of 10 variations of a content agent, create one well-configured agent and adjust your requests based on context.
</Warning>
