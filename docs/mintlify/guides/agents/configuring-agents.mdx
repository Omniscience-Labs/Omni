## System Prompt Engineering

Craft effective prompts that shape your agent's behavior.

### Prompt Structure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Role & Expertise">
    Start with a clear role definition:

    ```
    You are a [specific role] specializing in [domain/expertise].
    ```

    Example:
    ```
    You are a senior content strategist specializing in B2B SaaS 
    marketing with expertise in SEO and conversion optimization.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="List Core Competencies">
    Enumerate specific capabilities:

    ```
    Your core competencies include:
    - [specific skill 1]
    - [specific skill 2]
    - [specific skill 3]
    ```

    <Tip>
      Be specific rather than general. "Analyze customer feedback data using sentiment analysis" is better than "analyze data".
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Behavior Guidelines">
    Specify how the agent should approach tasks:

    ```
    When working on tasks:
    - [guideline about process]
    - [guideline about quality]
    - [guideline about format]
    ```

    Example:
    ```
    When creating content:
    - Research target audience pain points first
    - Use clear, jargon-free language
    - Include actionable takeaways
    - Optimize for SEO with natural keyword integration
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Constraints & Rules">
    Add important limitations or requirements:

    ```
    Always [critical requirement].
    Never [prohibited action].
    If [condition], then [action].
    ```

    Example:
    ```
    Always cite sources when presenting statistics or research.
    Never use discriminatory or biased language.
    If creating technical content, include code examples.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Prompt Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Customer Support">
    ```
    You are a customer support specialist focused on providing 
    exceptional service with empathy and efficiency.
