    **Start New Conversations**:
    - Type in the input field to automatically create a new chat

    </Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Accessing Chats on Mobile

Omni's full chat interface works on mobile web browsers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open on Mobile Browser">
    Navigate to your organization's Omni URL on your phone's browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sign In with SSO">
    Use the same **Continue with Microsoft** or Google login process
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Switch Agents on Mobile">
    **Agent Switcher Location** (different from desktop):
    - Look at the text input area at the bottom
    - Find the dropdown button **left of the microphone icon**
    - Tap it to see list of available agents
    - Select the agent you want to use
    
    <Info>
      On mobile, the agent switcher is integrated into the input bar for easy thumb access.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Voice Input">
    Tap the **microphone button** to speak your requests - particularly useful on mobile devices
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Chat Lifecycle & Limitations

<Warning>
  **Inactive Chat Behavior**: Chats older than 30 days may experience issues:
  - Conversation history remains accessible
  - You can continue chatting in old threads
  - **Files may fail to load** in very old chats
  
  **Workaround**: If files won't load in an old chat:
  1. Copy the text of your original request
  2. Create a new chat with the same agent
  3. Paste the request to get fresh results
  4. Files will be accessible in the new chat
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Chat Workspace**: Each chat has its own isolated workspace (like its own computer). Files created in one chat are separate from other chats. This keeps your work organized but means you can't directly reference files across chats.
</Info>

## Crafting Effective Requests

The quality of your request directly impacts results.

### Request Structure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    **Less Effective**:
    ```
    "Write a blog post"
    ```

    **More Effective**:
    ```
    "Write a 1200-word blog post about sustainable manufacturing 
    for B2B decision-makers. Include:
    - Current industry challenges
    - 3 innovative solutions with case studies
    - Implementation roadmap
    - ROI considerations
    Target tone: Professional yet accessible"
    ```

    {/* 
      📸 MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Request Comparison
      - Side-by-side showing vague vs specific requests
      - Highlight the differences in detail
      - Show resulting outputs side by side
      - Size: 1600x800px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Context">
    Help the agent understand background:
    ```
    "Context: We're launching a new API for developers.
    
    Task: Create comprehensive API documentation including:
    - Authentication guide
    - 5 common use case examples with code
    - Error handling best practices
    
    Audience: JavaScript developers, intermediate level
    Format: Markdown with code blocks"
    ```

    <Info>
      More context = better results. Include relevant background information upfront.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify Desired Format">
    Tell the agent how to structure output:
    - "Create a table comparing..."
    - "Generate a bulleted list of..."
    - "Write in Q&A format..."
    - "Produce a step-by-step guide..."
    - "Format as JSON with..."

    Formats the agent understands:
    - Tables, lists, outlines
    - Code blocks with language
    - Markdown, HTML, JSON
    - Charts and visualizations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Include Examples">
    Show what "good" looks like:
    ```
    "Write product descriptions similar to this example:
    
    [paste example]
    
    Maintain the same tone, structure, and level of detail
    for these products: [list]"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Isn't Understanding" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **If results miss the mark**:
    1. Provide more specific details
    2. Include an example of what you want
    3. Break complex tasks into smaller steps
    4. Ask the agent to explain its plan first

    ```
    "Let me clarify what I need. I want [specific outcome] 
    formatted like [example]. The key difference from what 
    you provided is [specific change needed]."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Task Taking Too Long" icon="clock">
    **For lengthy operations**:
    - Agent shows progress updates
    - You can continue other work
    - Return to check status anytime
    - Receive notification when complete

    Normal for: Large datasets, extensive research, complex analysis
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unexpected Results" icon="exclamation">
    **When output isn't what you expected**:
    ```
    "This isn't quite right. I was expecting [describe]
    but got [what you received]. Can you revise to 
    focus on [specific aspects]?"
    ```

    Agent will adjust based on your feedback.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Want to Start Over" icon="rotate-left">
    **To reset a task**:
    1. Click **New Thread** for fresh start
    2. Or say: "Let's start over with a different approach"
    3. Previous work remains in original thread

    Original files and context preserved.

## Advanced Tips

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chain Tasks">
    Build on previous work:
    ```
    1. "Analyze this dataset"
    2. "Now create visualizations from your findings"
    3. "Use those charts in a presentation"
    4. "Export as PDF and prepare an email summary"
    ```

    Each step uses results from the previous one.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Template Requests">
    Create reusable patterns:
    ```
    "For all future product descriptions:
    - Start with key benefit
    - List 3 main features
    - Include use case example
    - End with clear CTA
    
    Format as HTML with specific classes..."
    ```

    Agent maintains consistency.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Quality Controls">
    Set expectations:
    ```
    "Before finalizing:
    - Verify all statistics are current
