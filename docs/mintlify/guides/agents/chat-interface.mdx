## Crafting Effective Requests

The quality of your request directly impacts results.

### Request Structure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    **Less Effective**:
    ```
    "Write a blog post"
    ```

    **More Effective**:
    ```
    "Write a 1200-word blog post about sustainable manufacturing 
    for B2B decision-makers. Include:
    - Current industry challenges
    - 3 innovative solutions with case studies
    - Implementation roadmap
    - ROI considerations
    Target tone: Professional yet accessible"
    ```

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Request Comparison
      - Side-by-side showing vague vs specific requests
      - Highlight the differences in detail
      - Show resulting outputs side by side
      - Size: 1600x800px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Context">
    Help the agent understand background:
    ```
    "Context: We're launching a new API for developers.
    
    Task: Create comprehensive API documentation including:
    - Authentication guide
    - 5 common use case examples with code
    - Error handling best practices
    
    Audience: JavaScript developers, intermediate level
    Format: Markdown with code blocks"
    ```

    <Info>
      More context = better results. Include relevant background information upfront.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify Desired Format">
    Tell the agent how to structure output:
    - "Create a table comparing..."
    - "Generate a bulleted list of..."
    - "Write in Q&A format..."
    - "Produce a step-by-step guide..."
    - "Format as JSON with..."

    Formats the agent understands:
    - Tables, lists, outlines
    - Code blocks with language
    - Markdown, HTML, JSON
    - Charts and visualizations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Include Examples">
    Show what "good" looks like:
    ```
    "Write product descriptions similar to this example:
    
    [paste example]
    
    Maintain the same tone, structure, and level of detail
    for these products: [list]"
    ```
  </Step>
