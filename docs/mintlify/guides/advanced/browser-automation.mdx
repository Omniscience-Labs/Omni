## When to Use Browser Automation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Browser For">
    ‚úÖ **Dynamic Content**:
    - JavaScript-heavy sites
    - Single Page Applications (SPAs)
    - Content loaded on scroll
    - Interactive elements

    ‚úÖ **Authentication Required**:
    - Login-protected pages
    - Session-based access
    - Cookie requirements

    ‚úÖ **Complex Interactions**:
    - Multi-step forms
    - Drag and drop interfaces
    - File uploads through browser
    - CAPTCHA solving (with human assistance)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Simpler Alternatives">
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't Use Browser If**:
    - Simple webpage scraping (use web_scrape instead)
    - API available (use direct API)
    - Static content only
    - Public data (use data providers)

    Browser automation is powerful but resource-intensive.

    <Tip>
      Try simpler methods first. Use browser only when necessary.
    </Tip>

## Basic Browser Actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to URL">
    ```
    "Go to https://example.com"
    ```

    Agent opens URL in browser and waits for page load.

    {/* 
      üì∏ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Browser Navigation
      - Browser window showing loaded page
      - URL bar highlighted
      - Page load indicator
      - Screenshot confirmation
      - Size: 1600x900px
    */}
  </Step>

  <Step title="Interact with Elements">
    Click, type, select:
    ```
    "Click the 'Sign In' button"
    "Type 'search query' in the search box"
    "Select 'Premium' from the plan dropdown"
    ```

    Agent finds elements intelligently.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract Information">
    Pull data from page:
    ```
    "Extract all product names and prices from the page"
    "Save the article text to a file"
    "Get all links from the navigation menu"
    ```

    Structured data from unstructured pages.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify with Screenshots">
    Agent automatically captures screenshots after each action:
    - Visual confirmation
    - Debugging reference
    - Documentation evidence

    {/* 
      üé• VIDEO PLACEHOLDER: Browser Automation Flow (45 seconds)
      - Navigate to site
      - Click through multi-step process
      - Fill form fields
      - Screenshots captured at each step
      - Final success state
    */}

    <Check>
      Every action is visually verified!
    </Check>
  </Step>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Explicit Waits" icon="hourglass">
    **Always Wait for Elements**:
    ```
    ‚ùå "Click submit button"  (may click before loaded)
    
    ‚úÖ "Wait for submit button to appear, then click it"
    ```

    Prevents timing failures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Visual Verification" icon="camera">
    **Review Screenshots**:
    - Agent captures after each action
    - Verify expected behavior
    - Catch unexpected changes
    - Document successful flows

    Screenshots are automatic - use them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Recovery" icon="life-ring">
    **Handle Failures Gracefully**:
    ```
    "If CAPTCHA appears, notify me for manual solving"
    "If page doesn't load, retry twice then report error"
    "If element not found, wait 5 seconds and try again"
    ```

    Build resilient automation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Respect Rate Limits" icon="gauge">
    **Polite Scraping**:
    - Add delays between requests
    - Don't overwhelm servers
    - Check robots.txt
    - Honor rate limits

    Ethical automation matters.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **What Browser Automation Can't Do**:
  - Solve CAPTCHAs (requires human)
  - Bypass bot detection on protected sites
  - Access content behind paywalls (without credentials)
  - Execute faster than human speed (deliberately throttled)
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Performance Note**: Browser automation is slower than API calls. Use for visual verification and interaction, not bulk data processing.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Element Not Found" icon="magnifying-glass-minus">
    **Causes**:
    - Page still loading
    - Element description unclear
    - Element hidden or removed
    - Wrong page loaded

    **Solutions**:
    - Add explicit wait time
    - Describe element more specifically
    - Check screenshot for actual page state
    - Verify navigation succeeded
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timeout Errors" icon="clock">
    **When Pages Take Too Long**:
    - Increase wait time
    - Check internet connection
    - Verify site is accessible
    - Try different time of day

    Some sites are slow - adjust timeout accordingly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Action Failed" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Debug Steps**:
    1. Review screenshot from failed step
    2. Check browser console logs
    3. Verify element selector
    4. Test action manually
    5. Adjust approach based on findings

    Screenshots are your best debugging tool.
