## Agents

**Agents** are autonomous AI workers configured with specific capabilities, knowledge, and integrations. Each agent can have its own personality, tools, and purpose.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom Configuration" icon="sliders">
    Each agent has its own set of enabled tools, connected services, and knowledge base access
  </Card>
  <Card title="Specialized Roles" icon="user-tie">
    Agents can be specialized for research, content creation, data analysis, or custom workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Marketplace Ready" icon="store">
    Share your agents with the team or install pre-built agents from the marketplace
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic Task Breakdown" icon="list-check">
    Agents automatically break complex requests into smaller tasks and show their plan
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **How Agents Work**: When you give an agent a complex task, it automatically breaks it down into smaller steps (e.g., "Creating tasks: 1. Research and image collection 2. Content creation 3. Communication"). This planning is done by the AI's own reasoning, not pre-programmed steps.
</Info>

{/*

## Projects & Threads

**Projects** organize your work, and **Threads** are individual conversations within a project.

### Projects

Think of projects as workspaces for related tasks:

- **Marketing Campaign** - All agents and threads related to a campaign
- **Q4 Research** - Research tasks and findings for the quarter
- **Customer Onboarding** - Automated workflows for new customers

{/* 
  ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Projects View
  - Screenshot of projects list/grid
  - Show 4-6 project cards with names, descriptions, dates
  - Include project icons and member avatars
  - Display thread count and activity indicators
  - Size: 1800x1000px
*/}

### Threads

Each thread is a conversation with an agent where you can:

- Assign tasks and track progress
- View all files and outputs
- See tool usage and execution history
- Continue conversations over time

{/* 
  ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Thread Sidebar
  - Screenshot of thread history sidebar
  - Show chronological list of threads with titles
  - Include timestamps and agent avatars
  - Display "New Thread" button prominently
  - Highlight active thread
  - Size: 400x1000px (tall, narrow sidebar view)
*/}

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: Create separate threads for different tasks within a project to keep conversations organized and context-focused.
</Info>

---

## The Sandbox Environment

Every agent operates in a secure, isolated **sandbox** - a containerized environment where code executes and files are managed.

<Info>
  **Chat Workspaces**: Each chat you create has its own isolated workspace - think of it as giving the agent its own computer for that conversation. Files created in one chat are separate from other chats. This keeps work organized and prevents conflicts.
</Info>

### What's Inside the Sandbox?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File System" icon="folder-tree">
    A complete file system where agents can create, edit, and organize files. All files for a chat live in that chat's workspace.
    
    Access files through the **Files panel** on the right side of the chat interface. Download files to your computer or share them with others.
    
    {/* 
      ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: File Browser Interface

    A headless Chromium browser for web automation, scraping, and testing. Agents can navigate websites just like you do.
    
    {/* 
      ðŸŽ¥ VIDEO PLACEHOLDER: Browser Automation (30-40 seconds)
      - Show browser opening a website
      - Display form filling or data extraction
      - Include visual confirmation screenshots
      - Show extracted data being saved
    */}
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Internet Access" icon="globe">
    Agents can search the web, scrape content, and call APIs to gather real-time information.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Security & Isolation

<Card title="Enterprise-Grade Security" icon="shield-check">
  - Each agent runs in its own isolated container
  - No access to other users' data or environments
  - Automatic cleanup after sessions
  - Secure credential management for integrations
</Card>

## Knowledge Base

The **Knowledge Base** is your agent's long-term memory - a collection of documents, files, and data that agents can reference.

{/* 
  ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Knowledge Base Main View
  - Screenshot of knowledge base page
  - Show folder organization (tree structure on left)
  - Display file grid/list in center
  - Include upload area at top
  - Show search bar with semantic search hint
  - Size: 2000x1200px
*/}

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Documents">
    Drag and drop files or folders. Supported formats include PDF, Word, Excel, CSV, text files, code, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Organize with Folders">
    Create a folder structure that makes sense for your team - by project, department, or topic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Semantic Search">
    Agents use AI-powered search to find relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Context">
    When agents need information, they automatically search the knowledge base and pull in relevant context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

{/* 
  ðŸŽ¥ VIDEO PLACEHOLDER: Knowledge Base in Action (45-60 seconds)
  - Show user uploading documents
  - Display folder organization
  - Show agent being asked a question
  - Agent searching knowledge base (visual indicator)
  - Agent responding with sourced information
  - Include file references in response
*/}

<Tip>
  Upload your company's documentation, reports, and resources to give agents deep context about your business.
</Tip>

## Workflows & Triggers

**Workflows** are reusable sequences of steps, and **Triggers** automatically start agents on a schedule or event.

### Workflows

Pre-built sequences of instructions that agents follow:

```
Daily Report Workflow:
1. Check Gmail for messages from yesterday
2. Pull data from Google Sheets
3. Analyze trends and create visualizations
4. Generate summary report
5. Send via Slack to #reports channel
```

{/* 
  ðŸ“¸ MEDIA PLACEHOLDER: Workflow Builder
