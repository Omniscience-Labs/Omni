title: 'API Reference (Developers Only)'
description: 'API documentation for developers building on Omni'
---

<Warning>
  **For Developers Only**: This section is for developers building integrations, custom tools, or programmatic access to Omni.
  
  **Most users don't need this** - use the Omni UI instead by logging in to your workspace and using the chat interface. See the [Quick Start Guide](/quickstart) for UI-based usage.
</Warning>

<Info>
  The API reference below uses example "Plant Store" endpoints from the Mintlify starter template. This serves as a reference for how Omni's API documentation will be structured for developers.
  
  If you're looking to use Omni (not develop on it), go back to the [Introduction](/introduction) instead.

## API Documentation (Example)

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

<Card
  title="Plant Store Endpoints"
  icon="leaf"
  href="https://github.com/mintlify/starter/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.json"
>
  View the OpenAPI specification file

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
