## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In with SSO">
    Access Omni through your organization's single sign-on:
    - Click **Continue with Microsoft** for enterprise deployments
    - Or use **Continue with Google** for Google Workspace
    - Complete two-factor authentication if required
    - First-time users receive a guided tour of the interface
    
    <Tip>
      Your admin will send an invitation email with access instructions. Omni uses your existing enterprise credentials - no separate password needed.
    </Tip>
