## What is Omni?

Omni is an enterprise AI agent platform that enables your team to build, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents that handle complex workflows. From research and data analysis to content creation and automation, Omni agents work alongside your team to boost productivity.

<Info>
  **Endless Capabilities**: Omni agents are capable of doing almost anything - from creating presentations and generating images to analyzing data and sending emails. However, because agents are so capable, it's important to be specific in your requests and use specialized agents for recurring tasks to avoid overcomplications.
