        - Ensure storage quota available
        - Try smaller file or different format

        4. Paste the request to regenerate results
        5. All files will be fresh and accessible
        
        <Tip>

    - Try different time of day

      <Accordion title="Agent takes too long" icon="hourglass-half">
        **Expected Times**:
        - Simple questions: 5-15 seconds

          **Solution**: Stop the chat if it's going off track. Either:
          - Be more specific in your request
