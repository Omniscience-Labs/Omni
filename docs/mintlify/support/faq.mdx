## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Omni?" icon="circle-info">
    Omni is an enterprise AI agent platform that enables teams to build, deploy, and manage autonomous AI agents. Agents can handle research, content creation, data analysis, automation, and integration with your existing tools.

    Unlike chatbots, Omni agents actively work on tasks, use tools, access your knowledge base, and produce deliverables with minimal supervision.
