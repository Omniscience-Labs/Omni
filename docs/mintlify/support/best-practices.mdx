## Agent Design Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focused Purpose" icon="bullseye">
    **One Agent, One Job**:

    ‚ùå **Bad**: Using OMNI agent for everything
    ```
    Problem: OMNI is a "super smart computer" that can do anything
    
    Risk: For simple tasks, it might:
    - Overcomplicate solutions
    - Build entire programming languages for simple documents
    - Take longer and cost more than necessary
    - Give inconsistent results for same request
    ```

    ‚úÖ **Good**: Specialized agents for recurring tasks
    ```
    - Quotation Agent: Generate quotes consistently
    - Report Agent: Weekly reports in same format
    - Email Agent: Draft responses in company voice
    - Research Agent: Industry analysis with citations
    (each excels at its specific domain)
    ```

    <Warning>
      **Watch for Overcomplications**: If your agent starts doing something excessive (like building a new language to create a document), stop the chat immediately. Either be more specific in your request or create/use a specialized agent for that task type.
    </Warning>
    
    **When to Use OMNI vs Specialized**:
    - OMNI: One-off tasks, exploration, new requests
    - Specialized: Recurring tasks, consistent format needed, specific workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Detailed System Prompts" icon="file-lines">
    **Effective Prompts Include**:

    ‚úÖ **Specific Role**: "Senior data analyst specialized in e-commerce analytics"
    
    ‚úÖ **Core Competencies**: List 5-7 specific skills
    
    ‚úÖ **Behavior Guidelines**: How to approach tasks
    
    ‚úÖ **Output Format**: Structure and style expectations
    
    ‚úÖ **Constraints**: What to never do

    **Example**:
    ```
    You are a senior data analyst specializing in 
    e-commerce analytics with expertise in customer 
    behavior, conversion optimization, and predictive modeling.

    Core Competencies:
    - Cohort and retention analysis
    - Funnel optimization
    - A/B test design and analysis
    - Customer segmentation
    - Revenue forecasting

    When analyzing data:
    - Start with exploratory analysis
    - Validate data quality first
    - Use appropriate statistical methods
    - Create clear visualizations
    - Provide actionable recommendations

    Deliverable Format:
    - Executive summary (non-technical)
    - Detailed findings with charts
    - Statistical methodology notes
    - Recommendations with confidence levels

    Never make causal claims without proper analysis.
    Always note assumptions and limitations.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Right Tools Only" icon="wrench">
    **Enable What You Need**:

    Research Agent:
    - ‚úÖ Web Search
    - ‚úÖ File Operations
    - ‚ùå Browser (unless scraping needed)
    - ‚ùå Image Generation
    - ‚ùå Code Execution

    More tools ‚â† better performance. Minimal = focused.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Curated Knowledge" icon="books">
    **Quality Over Quantity**:
    - Upload relevant documents only
    - Remove outdated content regularly
    - Organize logically
    - Use descriptive filenames
    - Update with product changes

    **Real Example**:
    ```
    Electrical Quotation Agent Knowledge Base:
    - NECA manual (material cost reference)
    - Historic quotations (pricing patterns)
    - Labor hour standards
    - Company letterhead (default file)
    
    Result: Agent generates accurate quotes by referencing 
    proven standards and past work
    ```

    Clean knowledge base = better responses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Help Button for Agent Creation" icon="life-ring">
    **Work with Omni Team**:
    
    Instead of struggling to create complex agents yourself:
    1. Click the **Help** button
    2. Select **Agent Request**
    3. Describe your use case and workflow
    4. Schedule 30-minute consultation
    5. Omni team builds optimized agent for you

    - Avoid common configuration mistakes
    - Get best practices built in
    - Save time and get better results
    
    Included in Professional and Enterprise plans.

## Effective Prompting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Specific">
    **Vague vs Specific**:

    ‚ùå Vague:
    ```
    "Write a blog post about AI"
    ```

    ‚úÖ Specific:
    ```
    "Write a 1500-word blog post about AI applications 
    in healthcare for hospital administrators:
    
    - Target audience: C-suite healthcare leaders
    - Tone: Professional, evidence-based
    - Include: 3 case studies, ROI data, implementation roadmap
    - SEO keyword: 'AI in healthcare'
    - CTA: Request demo"
    ```

    Specificity drives quality.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Context">
    **Give Background**:
    ```
    Context: We're launching a new API for developers.
    Our main competitors are X and Y. Our differentiator 
    is Z. Target audience is JavaScript developers.
    
    Task: Create API documentation that highlights our 
    advantages and makes onboarding smooth.
    ```

    Context shapes approach.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Show Examples">
    **Demonstrate Desired Output**:
    ```
    "Create product descriptions like this example:
    
    [paste example]
    
    Match the:
    - Tone and style
    - Information depth
    - Format and structure
    - Length (~200 words)
    
    Create for these products: [list]"
    ```

    Examples eliminate ambiguity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Iterate">
    **Refine Progressively**:
    ```
    First: "Draft a product announcement"
    Then: "Make it more exciting and add customer quotes"
    Then: "Shorten to 300 words and add a clear CTA"
    Finally: "Perfect! Now create social media versions"
    ```

    Iteration over perfection on first try.

    <Tip>
      Don't aim for perfection in the first response. Refine through conversation.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
  **Don't Do These**:

  ‚ùå **Entering passwords or sensitive credentials in chat**
  ‚Üí Use integrations and OAuth instead - never type passwords in messages

  ‚ùå Creating too many similar agents
  ‚Üí Create one well-configured agent instead

  ‚ùå Overly complex workflows
  ‚Üí Start simple, add complexity only if needed

  ‚ùå Ignoring Knowledge Base
  ‚Üí Upload relevant docs for better results

  ‚ùå No error handling in workflows
  ‚Üí Always plan for failures

  ‚ùå Scheduling everything at same time
  ‚Üí Stagger tasks throughout the day

  ‚ùå Not testing before production
  ‚Üí Test thoroughly with real scenarios

  ‚ùå Unclear agent names and descriptions
  ‚Üí Use descriptive, searchable names

  ‚ùå Granting excessive permissions
  ‚Üí Principle of least privilege
  
  ‚ùå Using OMNI agent for specialized recurring tasks
  ‚Üí Create dedicated agents for consistency
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Security Best Practice**: Never type passwords, API keys, or sensitive credentials directly in chat messages. Use Omni's integration system which handles authentication securely through OAuth.
