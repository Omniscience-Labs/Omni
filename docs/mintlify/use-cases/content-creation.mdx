## Presentation Generation

Create professional slide decks from simple prompts:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Presentation">
    ```
    "Create a simple presentation about the importance of wearing 
    gloves while touching live wires - make it really funny"
    
    Or more detailed:
    
    "Create a 10-slide safety presentation about electrical PPE:
    - Slide 1: Title slide
    - Slide 2-3: Why safety matters (statistics)
    - Slide 4-7: Required equipment with images
    - Slide 8-9: Real incident examples
    - Slide 10: Compliance and conclusion"
    ```
    
    The more specific you are, the better the output.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Agent Generates Content">
    Agent creates the full presentation:
    - Researches topic if needed
    - Structures slides logically
    - Writes engaging content
    - Can include humor if requested
    - Generates as HTML preview and PPTX
    
    <Tip>
      Be specific about tone. The same presentation can be "professional and data-driven" or "funny and engaging" based on your prompt.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Download and Edit">
    - Preview in browser
    - Download as PowerPoint (.pptx)
    - Edit in PowerPoint or Google Slides
    - Add custom branding and images
    
    <Check>
      Presentation ready to customize and present!
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Image Generation

Create custom visuals from text descriptions:

**Example from Demo**:
```
"Generate an image of Houston Electric-related: an electrician 
and a robot dog like Unitree next to them in front of a solar 
panel area"

Result: Professional electrician in work uniform and hard hat 
standing next to a futuristic robot dog in a solar panel field
```

<Tip>
  **Detailed Prompts = Better Images**: Describe style, setting, subjects, mood, lighting, and composition for best results. The AI converts your description into detailed image generation prompts automatically.

    ```
    Agent: Electrical Quotation Specialist
    
    Knowledge Base:
    - NECA manual (material cost reference)
    - Historic quotations (pricing patterns)
    - Labor hour standards
    - Company letterhead template (default file)
    
    Input: Project scope and requirements
    
    Process:

    3. Calculates labor hours using standards
    4. References similar past projects for accuracy
    5. Generates quotation on company letterhead
    6. Formats in standard company style

    "Create a quotation for installing a 120-volt outdoor security 
    camera with power supply:
    - Location: Building exterior
    - Distance from panel: 150 feet
    - Conduit type: EMT
    - Wire size: 6 AWG
    - Include all materials and labor"
    ```

    - Looks up wire pulling costs for 6 AWG conductors
    - References historic camera installation projects
    - Calculates total material and labor costs
    - Formats on Houston Electric letterhead (from default files)
    - Produces accurate, professional quotation
    
    <Warning>

      - Material pricing is current
      - Labor hours are accurate
      - Calculations are correct
      - Project scope fully captured
      
      The agent accelerates quotation creation but doesn't replace human expertise and approval.
