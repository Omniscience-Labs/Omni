## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Verify TODO Items**: Review all features marked with #TODO comments to confirm:
   - Feature exists and works as documented
   - Remove TODO if verified
   - Update documentation if behavior differs
   - Remove entire section if feature doesn't exist

2. **Projects/Threads Clarification**: Demo used "chats" terminology extensively. Verify:
   - Are "projects" and "threads" separate organizational features?
   - Or are they the same as "chats"?
   - Update or remove entire projects section accordingly

3. **Media Assets**: Create screenshots and videos for:
   - Voice recording button
   - Mobile web agent switcher
   - Help button interface
   - Integration profile list
   - Files panel
   - Chat delete/rename
   - OneDrive integration

4. **Additional Demo Resources**: 
   - Embed or link the 21-minute video tutorial
   - Make PDFs accessible from help section
   - Reference these in onboarding flow

5. **Testing Checklist**:
   - Test all documented workflows
   - Verify all code examples
   - Check all internal links
   - Validate all TODO markers
   - Ensure mobile web accuracy
