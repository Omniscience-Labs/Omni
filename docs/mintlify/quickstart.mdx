    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch Your Agent Work">
    Your agent will break down the task into steps and execute them. You'll see:

    - **Planning**: Agent shows its approach first - "Creating tasks: 1. Research and image collection 2. Content creation 3. Communication..."
    - **Tool Usage**: Visual indicators when using tools (browser, search, files, email)
    - **Progress Updates**: Real-time status as each task step completes
    - **Results**: Final output with supporting files
    
    <Info>
      **Task Breakdown**: For any complex request, the agent automatically breaks it into smaller tasks. This planning is done by the AI itself - you'll see the steps it intends to take before it starts executing.
    </Info>
    
    <Tip>
      You can continue working in other tabs while the agent processes. Return to the chat anytime to check progress or see results.

## Tips for Success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    The more details you provide, the better your results. Include context, desired format, and any constraints.
    
    **Good**: "Create a 5-slide presentation about Q4 results with charts, use corporate blue theme"
    
    **Less Good**: "Make a presentation about Q4"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Break Down Complex Tasks" icon="list-check">
    For large projects, break them into smaller steps. This gives you more control and better results.
    
    Instead of: "Build a complete marketing campaign"
    
    Try: "First, research our target audience. Then we'll create messaging, then design materials."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide Examples" icon="copy">
    When you want a specific style or format, show your agent an example.
    
    "Write a product description similar to this: [paste example]"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Follow-Ups" icon="comments">
    Don't hesitate to refine results. Say "Make it more concise" or "Add more data points" to iterate quickly.
  </Accordion>
