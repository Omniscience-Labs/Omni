# HeyGen Video Avatar Tool - Async Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the HeyGen video avatar tool to provide better async functionality with intelligent polling, sandbox downloads, and improved user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 🔄 **Enhanced Async Polling**
- **Increased Timeout**: Extended from 90 seconds to **300 seconds** (5 minutes)
- **Smart Polling Intervals**:
  - First 2 checks: Every 5 seconds (for quick videos)  
  - Next 4 checks: Every 10 seconds
  - Next 6 checks: Every 15 seconds
  - Remaining: Every 20 seconds (for longer videos)

### 📁 **Sandbox Integration**
- Videos are automatically downloaded to the sandbox when ready
- Tool only responds when the video is **completely finished and available**
- Proper file path handling and metadata storage

### 🔍 **Better Status Tracking**
- Enhanced logging with emoji indicators
- Progress tracking with elapsed time
- Detailed error messages with actionable suggestions

### ⚙️ **Default Configuration**
- `async_polling: true` by default (best experience)
- `max_wait_time: 300` seconds by default
- Intelligent fallback options for timeouts

### 🎯 **User Experience**
- Clear progress indicators in logs
- Comprehensive timeout messages with next steps
- Proper error handling with retry instructions

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files
- `backend/agent/tools/sb_video_avatar_tool.py`
  - Updated OpenAPI schema descriptions
  - Enhanced `generate_avatar_video()` method
  - Improved `_async_poll_and_download()` method
  - Better polling intervals and timeout handling

### New Behavior
1. **Start Generation**: Video generation begins immediately
2. **Smart Polling**: Intelligent intervals based on expected completion time
3. **Download on Ready**: Automatic download to sandbox when complete
4. **Success Response**: Only returns when video is fully available

## Usage Example

```python
# The tool will now intelligently wait and download automatically
result = await tool.generate_avatar_video(
    text="Hello, it's the 19th!",
    video_title="Daily Update Video",
    async_polling=True,  # Default: True
    max_wait_time=300    # Default: 300 seconds
)

# Response only comes when video is ready and downloaded to sandbox!
```
