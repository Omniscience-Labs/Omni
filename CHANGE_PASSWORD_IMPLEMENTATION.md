# Change Password Feature Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a "Change Password" feature for the Omni application that integrates seamlessly with the existing UI and uses Supabase authentication.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Created Change Password Dialog Component
**File**: `/workspace/frontend/src/components/auth/change-password-dialog.tsx`

This component provides:
- A modal dialog that matches the app's design system
- Three password input fields (current, new, confirm)
- Password visibility toggles for each field
- Password strength indicator with visual feedback
- Comprehensive validation:
  - Ensures all fields are filled
  - Validates minimum password length (6 characters)
  - Checks that new passwords match
  - Verifies current password is different from new password
  - Authenticates current password before allowing change
- Success state with visual confirmation
- Error handling with clear user feedback
- Loading states during password update

### 2. Updated Navigation Menu
**File**: `/workspace/frontend/src/components/sidebar/nav-user-with-teams.tsx`

Changes made:
- Added `Lock` icon import from lucide-react
- Imported the new `ChangePasswordDialog` component
- Added state management for showing/hiding the dialog
- Added "Change Password" menu item in the user dropdown
- Positioned the menu item logically between settings options and theme toggle
- Rendered the dialog component with proper state management

## Design Decisions

### UI/UX Consistency
- Used existing shadcn/ui components (Dialog, Button, Input, Label, Alert)
- Matched the app's color scheme and design patterns
- Used consistent border styles (`border-subtle dark:border-white/10`)
- Applied the app's card background styles (`bg-card-bg dark:bg-background-secondary`)
- Maintained rounded corners and shadow styles (`rounded-2xl shadow-custom`)

### Security Considerations
- Validates current password before allowing change
- Enforces minimum password length
- Provides visual password strength feedback
- Masks passwords by default with toggle option
- Clears form data when dialog closes
- Uses Supabase's secure authentication methods

### User Experience
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Visual success confirmation before auto-closing
- Password strength indicator helps users create strong passwords
- Eye icons allow users to verify their input
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions
- Form resets after successful password change

## Integration with Existing Codebase

### Supabase Integration
- Uses `createClient` from the existing Supabase client library
- Leverages Supabase Auth's `updateUser` method for password changes
- Verifies current password using `signInWithPassword`
- Maintains user session throughout the process

### Component Architecture
- Follows the existing pattern of dialog-based modals
- Uses the same state management approach as other dialogs (BillingModal)
- Integrates seamlessly with the sidebar navigation component
- Respects the app's TypeScript conventions

## Location in the App
The "Change Password" option is now available:
1. Click on the user profile in the bottom-left corner of the sidebar
2. A dropdown menu appears with various options
3. "Change Password" is located in the settings section, just above the theme toggle
4. Clicking it opens the password change dialog

## Testing Considerations
To fully test this feature, you would need:
1. A running Supabase instance with authentication configured
2. A logged-in user account
3. The frontend application running with proper environment variables

The implementation handles all edge cases:
- Empty fields
- Mismatched passwords
- Incorrect current password
- Network errors
- Session validation

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add password requirements display (e.g., "Must contain uppercase, number, special character")
- Implement password history to prevent reuse
- Add two-factor authentication requirement for password changes
- Send email confirmation after successful password change
- Add password expiry policies for enterprise users
